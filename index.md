# Raspberry Pi Stoplight
This project involved creating a webserver on a raspberry pi to control an LED stoplight via the pi's GPIO pins.

## Objectives
* Learn to enumerate requirements from use cases and user stories
* Learn to utilize the general purpose input/output (GPIO) pins on the Raspberry Pi to control LEDs
* Learn to develop a minimum viable product, and deliver new functionality through subsequent updates
until the requirements are met, and all of the deliverables are acceptable.
* Learn to use Github for progressive code commits and version tracking.

## Materials
The materials used in this lab were:
* Laptop
* Raspberry Pi
* 4x male to female wires
* 1x LED stoplight
* 1x breadboard
* LucidChart
